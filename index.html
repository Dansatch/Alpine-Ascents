            <p>Mountaineering, also called mountain climbing, the sport of attaining, or attempting 
                to attain, high points in mountainous regions, mainly for the pleasure of the climb. 
                Although the term is often loosely applied to walking up low mountains that offer 
                only moderate difficulties, it is more properly restricted to climbing in localities 
                where the terrain and weather conditions present such hazards that, for safety, a 
                certain amount of previous experience will be found necessary. For the untrained, 
                mountaineering is a dangerous pastime.Mountaineering, otherwise known as mountain climbing, 
                is a very popular outdoor sport. There are thousands of mountains in the world, all with their 
                own unique terrain, their own challenges and excitements. 
                <br><br>
                Mountaineering differs from other outdoor sports in that nature alone provides the field of 
                action—and just about all of the challenges—for the participant. Climbing mountains embodies the 
                thrills produced by testing one’s courage, resourcefulness, cunning, strength, ability, and stamina 
                to the utmost in a situation of inherent risk. Mountaineering, to a greater degree than other sports, 
                is a group activity, with each member both supporting and supported by the group’s achievement at every stage. 
                For most climbers, the pleasures of mountaineering lie not only in the “conquest” of a peak but also in 
                the physical and spiritual satisfactions brought about through intense personal effort, ever-increasing 
                proficiency, and contact with natural grandeur.
                <br><br>
                Technically anybody could walk to the top of a mountain but this would not 
                make them a mountaineer. Mountaineering can best be described as the ascent of 
                any hill or mountain where the gradient and severity of the terrain requires 
                some form of climbing and the sustained use of technical equipment.
                <br><br>
                In summer this equipment can include a helmet, rope, harness, karabiner and 
                protective climbing equipment, and in winter will include the addition of 
                crampons, an ice axe and protective ice-climbing equipment.
                <br><br>
                Mountaineering will inevitably involve periods of hill walking but what 
                distinguishes these two activities is whether you need to use technical 
                equipment in order to reach your objective: the summit!
                <br><br>
                There are numerous benefits to mountaineering. The most obvious benefits are 
                improving both your physical fitness and cardiovascular fitness levels as well 
                as reducing body fat through aerobic exercise. Some other less obvious or ‘less 
                tangible’ benefits include greatly improving your own personal confidence and team 
                working skills, which you will use in your work and personal life without even realising it!

                    Early attempts to ascend mountain peaks were inspired by other than sporting motives: 
                    to build altars or to see if spirits actually haunted once-forbidden heights, to get 
                    an overview of one’s own or a neighbouring countryside, or to make meteorological or 
                    geological observations. Before the modern era, history recorded few attempts to 
                    ascend mountain peaks for the mere sake of the accomplishment. During the 18th 
                    century a growing number of natural philosophers—the scientists of their day—began 
                    making field trips into the Alps of Europe to make scientific observations. The area 
                    around Chamonix, France, became a special attraction to those investigators because 
                    of the great glaciers on the Mont Blanc chain.
                    <br><br>
                    Mountaineering in a contemporary sporting sense was born when a young Genevese 
                    scientist, Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, on a first visit to Chamonix in 1760, viewed 
                    Mont Blanc (at 15,771 feet [4,807 metres] the tallest peak in Europe) and determined 
                    that he would climb to the top of it or be responsible for its being climbed. He 
                    offered prize money for the first ascent of Mont Blanc, but it was not until 1786, 
                    more than 25 years later, that his money was claimed—by a Chamonix doctor, Michel-Gabriel 
                    Paccard, and his porter, Jacques Balmat. 
                    <span class="readMoreParagraph">
                            A year later de Saussure himself climbed to the summit 
                        of Mont Blanc. After 1850 groups of British climbers with Swiss, Italian, or French guides scaled 
                        one after another of the high peaks of Switzerland. A landmark climb in the growth of the sport was the spectacular 
                        first ascent of the Matterhorn (14,692 feet [4,478 metres]) on July 14, 1865, by a party led by an 
                        English artist, Edward Whymper. In the mid-19th century the Swiss developed a coterie of guides whose 
                        leadership helped make mountaineering a distinguished sport as they led the way to peak after peak 
                        throughout central Europe.
                        <br><br>
                        As the 20th century wore on, the truly international character of mountaineering began to 
                        reveal itself. Increasingly, Austrians, Chinese, English, French, Germans, Indians, Italians, 
                        Japanese, and Russians turned their attention to opportunities inherent in the largest mountain 
                        landmass of the planet, the Himalayas and neighbouring ranges. After World War I the British made 
                        Everest their particular goal. Meanwhile, climbers from other countries were making spectacularly 
                        successful climbs of other great Himalayan peaks. A Soviet team climbed Stalin Peak (24,590 feet 
                        [7,495 metres])—later renamed Communism Peak and then Imeni Ismail Samani Peak—in the Pamirs in 1933, 
                        a German party succeeded on Siniolchu (22,600 feet [6,888 metres]) in 1936, and the English climbed 
                        Nanda Devi (25,646 feet [7,817 metres]) the same year. In 1940–47The Alpine Journal of London, a reliable 
                        chronicler of ascents, listed for the first time no peaks ascended—a reflection, of course, of the 
                        imperatives of World War II.
                        <br><br>
                        Beginning in the 1960s, mountaineering underwent several transformations. Once peaks were climbed, the 
                        emphasis moved to a search for increasingly difficult routes up the mountain face to the summit, as in 
                        the golden age of the Alpine ascents. A notable example was the 1963 ascent of the West Face of Everest 
                        by two members of the first American team to climb the mountain. Moreover, vertical or other so-called 
                        impossible rock faces were being scaled through the use of newly developed artificial aids and advanced 
                        climbing techniques. Smooth vertical faces of granite were overcome in climbs lasting days or even 
                        weeks at a time—for example, the 27-day conquest by American climbers in 1970 of the sheer 3,600-foot 
                        (1,100-metre) southeast face of the granite monolith El Capitan in Yosemite National Park in the North 
                        American Sierra Nevada range. Other notable developments included an increase in the “Alpine” style of 
                        climbing the highest peaks, where mountaineers carried a minimal amount of equipment and supplies and 
                        did not rely on porters and other outside support, and a rise in the number of people climbing at high 
                        elevations without the use of supplemental oxygen.

                    Alpine mountaineering is practiced in medium sized mountains, as opposed to the 
                    expedition style’s larger mountains.Alpine mountaineers pack light and move quick 
                    and they make a swift push to the peak. This is possible as medium sized mountains, 
                    like the Alps or the Rocky Mountains, can be scaled relatively more quickly.

                    <span>2. Expedition: </span>
                    Expedition mountaineers, on the other hand, move slow and carry much heavier loads. 
                    This is necessitated as these larger mountains, like the Himalayas and the Alaska Range, 
                    take weeks or months to climb and as the journey between base camps is much longer. 
                    Expeditioners can even travel with pack.

            <p>
                By climbing technique we mean a particular method of acting which the mountaineer 
                uses to move about in the terrain. While the climber progresses directly along 
                the rope (single rope technique) with rope techniques used in speleoalpinism, 
                work at heights or rescue work, in mountaineering or rock climbing the mountaineer 
                moves along climbing terrain during the ascent.
                At the same time the mountaineer has a choice of two climbing techniques: either free 
                climbing or technical climbing. With free climbing the climber overcomes gravity using 
                only her own strength and progresses uses only natural rock formations. At the same time 
                certain methods of protection techniques, meaning accessories and gear, are used simply to 
                protect her from a fall.
                In comparison to this, during technical climbing artificial resources are used for 
                progress, intermediate points protection (pitons, nuts, etc.) are grasped with the 
                hands and runners and other stirrups are hung from intermediate points of protection 
                placed in the rock and stepped in. Indeed technical climbing is so specific that it is 
                often perceived as an entirely independent mountaineering discipline.

                    <span>&#9632; Gaston: </span>
                    A gaston is the inverse of side pull. In a side pull, the hold is oriented so that you 
                    pull in, toward yourself. A gaston is also oriented for a sideways force, but instead 
                    of a pull in, it requires a push out.
                    The position is kind of like if you were trying to open an elevator door; your elbow 
                    is bent and pointing out to the side with your fingers pointing in toward you.
                    Gastons may feel unstable because all the force comes from your shoulder. But adding 
                    this move to your repertoire really opens up the wall.

                    Example of palming while rock climbing. Palming is the hand version of smearing: You push 
                    against the rock with an open palm.
                    Palming can help you maintain balance while you reposition your feet. It comes in 
                    handy if no good handholds are available. Palming is also useful when stemming because 
                    it allows you to apply counter pressure to a blank face. And on slab climbs, fingers-down 
                    palming is especially helpful.

                    Example of knee drop rock climbing move.
                    A drop knee is a more extreme back step. It works best when you have a foothold near 
                    hip level. Step onto it with the tip of your toe; then roll your knee in until the 
                    outside of your shoe rests on the hold and your knee actually points down.
                    Just like a back step, a drop knee gets your hip close to the wall. It’s great for a 
                    rest, but it’s especially great when you need extra reach on a steep or overhanging wall.

                    Example of stemming while rock climbing. 
                    Stemming is pushing against two opposing surfaces. This could be in a chimney, in a corner, 
                    or on an otherwise flat wall that has a big, protruding feature.
                    You can stem using any combination of hands and feet, but the key is to use counter 
                    pressure to stay in balance. Stemming relies on your big leg muscles, so it’s an extremely 
                    efficient way to climb, and can give you some great rests.

                    Example of flagging while rock climbing. Flagging is counter balancing by using a limb to 
                    shift your weight. The goal is to keep from swinging away from the rock.
                    Flagging is advantageous any time you’re using holds that are all on the same side of your 
                    body. Because that also stacks all your weight to one side, you simply swing that leg out 
                    to the other side of your body to keep yourself in balance.

                    <span>&#9632; Lay-backing: </span>
                    Lay-backing is when you pull and lean off one side of a flake or a crack and push your 
                    feet against the other side. When you have good footholds, laybacks are very efficient 
                    because your arms are straight and your feet do the hard work. When lack of good footholds 
                    requires you to smear, keep your heels low to maximize the amount of rubber against the rock.
                    You can use a lay-back any time you’re in a crack and jamming isn’t an option, or you’ve 
                    got an opposing wall to push off against, like in a dihedral crack.

                    Example of a mantle move while rock climbing. A mantle is when you push down on a hold and 
                    bring feet up to meet hands. A classic example of mantling is at the top of a climb when 
                    you need to pull yourself onto the ledge.
                    To mantle, push down on a hold to get your weight above it, then move your foot up to 
                    take the place of your hand.
                    Mantles are necessary when you top out, but are also useful mid-climb when you have a big 
                    handhold and you need to get your feet high.

                    Example of the undercling move in rock climbing. Like the name implies, an undercling is when 
                    you use the underside of a hold. Using underclings may feel counter-intuitive at first, 
                    because instead of pulling down on the hold, you’re pulling up.
                    One key to a good undercling is to find good, high footholds so you can maintain body 
                    tension by pushing with your feet as you pull on the hold. Keeping your feet high puts the 
                    hold around waist level and lets you keep your arms straighter.
                    When done right, a good undercling gets you in a solid position to reach up for some extra 
                    elevation.

                    Example of the side pull move when rock climbingA side pull is any hold that’s oriented 
                    for a sideways pull. The key to a well-executed side pull is to balance out that sideways 
                    pull by shifting your body weight or by applying a counter force.
                    Like underclings, side pulls can feel awkward because you have to adapt the direction of 
                    your pull to the orientation of the hold. But once that feeling clicks, suddenly you can 
                    use holds all around you, not just those straight above.

                    Is the essential element of all climbing, for in the end mountains are climbed by placing 
                    one foot in front of another over and over again. The most-arduous hours in mountaineering 
                    are those spent hiking or climbing slowly, steadily, hour after hour, on the trails of a 
                    mountain’s approach or lower slopes.

                    Like hiking, is a widely practiced sport in its own right. The essentials of rock climbing 
                    are often learned on local cliffs, where the teamwork of mountaineering, the use of the 
                    rope, and the coordinated prerequisites of control and rhythm are mastered. The rope, the 
                    artificial anchor, and carabiner (or snap link, a metal loop or ring that can be snapped 
                    into an anchor and through which the rope may be passed) are used primarily as safety factors. 
                    An exception occurs in tension climbing, in which the leader is supported by a judiciously placed 
                    series of anchors and carabiners through which the rope is passed. He or she is then supported on 
                    the rope by fellow climbers while slowly moving upward to place another anchor and repeat the 
                    process.

                Mountain climbing is a strenuous and often dangerous activity. Because the 
                weather conditions on mountains can change without notice, shelters can play a 
                critical role in keeping climbers safe and protected. This article takes a look at 
                the different types of shelters used by mountain climbers.

                    Base camps are most frequently used by mountain climbers who are trying to reach the 
                    summit of very high mountains. These shelters are often stocked with necessary supplies 
                    and provide climbers with a safe location for acclimatizing to extreme altitudes. When 
                    climbs to the summit take multiple days, several base camps may be located along the trails. 
                    Some of the most well-known base camps are located on Mount Everest.

                        Huts may be well-developed or rustic shelters, located in rural areas at differing elevations 
                        along a mountain. These shelters are designed around a shared dining area with private 
                        sleeping sleeping quarters. These sleeping rooms are stocked with a bed, pillows, and 
                        blankets. Climbers bring a sleeping bag. Like base camp, huts allow a trail to be divided 
                        into several days worth of hikes and make it possible for climbers to travel with a 
                        reduced pack. During warmer seasons, many huts have full-time staff or volunteers that 
                        manage the daily activities necessary to keep the shelter running. In some locations, 
                        climbers have the option to purchase snacks, meals, and drinks.

                        Tents consist of a pole framework, covered in a tarp or some other material and held by 
                        ropes and anchors. These shelters are set up at the moment it will be used and are easily 
                        portable. Simpler designs require just a thin tarp, while more durable designs incorporate 
                        heavier materials that can hold up against dangerous weather conditions. In extreme 
                        weather, tents may be set up behind mounds of snow or rock, which act as windbreaks and 
                        help protect the shelter. Tents are the most frequently used type of shelter.

                        Snow caves are preferred over tents by some climbers, where weather conditions permit. 
                        These shelters are known to be warmer than tents and have only 2 requirements: snow and 
                        a snow shovel. Climbers can build a snow cave in a short amount of time, digging out an 
                        area under at least 4 feet of snow. The inner temperature is usually around 32° fahrenheit 
                        and for added warmth, climbers use waterproof, lightweight bivvy bags and foam sleeping 
                        pads. Another type of snow cave is an igloo, although this requires a very specific 
                        construction technique and should only be attempted by those with experience.

                        A bivouac, also known as a bivvy, is a very rudimentary type of shelter. It does not 
                        offer a completely enclosed shelter and in some cases, may involve simply sleeping in 
                        the open. When in the open, climbers use a sleeping bag and cover it with a bivouac 
                        sack (or bivvy bag). A bivouac sack is a lightweight, waterproof liner that provides an 
                        additional layer of protection against inclement weather and cold temperatures. Climbers 
                        may also set up a bivouac between a crack in nearby rocks or a ditch formed in the snow, 
                        both of these offer more shelter. This shelter is often chosen because it allows climbers 
                        to carry a reduced-weight pack. A bivouac does have the added risk of climbers being more 
                        exposed to dangerous weather.

                <h1>About Sheltering</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>&#9632; Base Camp: </b>
                    Base camps are most frequently used by mountain climbers who are trying to reach the 
                    summit of very high mountains. These shelters are often stocked with necessary supplies 
                    and provide climbers with a safe location for acclimatizing to extreme altitudes. When 
                    climbs to the summit take multiple days, several base camps may be located along the trails. 
                    Some of the most well-known base camps are located on Mount Everest.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <b>&#9632; Hut: </b>
                    Huts may be well-developed or rustic shelters, located in rural areas at differing elevations 
                    along a mountain. These shelters are designed around a shared dining area with private 
                    sleeping sleeping quarters. These sleeping rooms are stocked with a bed, pillows, and 
                    blankets. Climbers bring a sleeping bag. Like base camp, huts allow a trail to be divided 
                    into several days worth of hikes and make it possible for climbers to travel with a 
                    reduced pack. During warmer seasons, many huts have full-time staff or volunteers that 
                    manage the daily activities necessary to keep the shelter running. In some locations, 
                    climbers have the option to purchase snacks, meals, and drinks.
                    <br><br>

                    
                    <b>&#9632; Tents: </b>
                    Tents consist of a pole framework, covered in a tarp or some other material and held by 
                    ropes and anchors. These shelters are set up at the moment it will be used and are easily 
                    portable. Simpler designs require just a thin tarp, while more durable designs incorporate 
                    heavier materials that can hold up against dangerous weather conditions. In extreme 
                    weather, tents may be set up behind mounds of snow or rock, which act as windbreaks and 
                    help protect the shelter. Tents are the most frequently used type of shelter.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>&#9632; Snow-cave: </b>
                    Snow caves are preferred over tents by some climbers, where weather conditions permit. 
                    These shelters are known to be warmer than tents and have only 2 requirements: snow and 
                    a snow shovel. Climbers can build a snow cave in a short amount of time, digging out an 
                    area under at least 4 feet of snow. The inner temperature is usually around 32° fahrenheit

                There are many hazards to mountain climbing that can ruin a summit or even cost a climber his life.
                Perhaps the most expected or common hazards are natural disasters, such as falling debris 
                or weather storms. Many people do not expect physical ailments to result in so many deaths. 
                Altitude and cardiac attacks can claim many lives, especially on the taller mountains, where 
                there is less oxygen available.
                <br><br>
                Climbing ascents up mountains, such as Mt. Everest, taken three to four months because of the time 
                needed to acclimatize to the lack of oxygen. Once climbers reach a certain elevation, there 
                are strategic base camps set up where climbers will spend days, weeks, or even months getting 
                used to (acclimatizing) to the lack of oxygen. 
                Falling, avalanche danger, exposure to the elements, and altitude sickness are among the most 
                prevalent risks that you’ll face while mountaineering, although that’s far from a comprehensive list.
                Now, this article isn’t meant to dissuade you from mountain climbing (I do it all the time, 
                and I love it), but rather to make you aware of the dangers so that you can plan for them!

            <p>
                The notable developments includes an increase in the “Alpine” style of climbing the 
                highest peaks, where mountaineers carried a minimal amount of equipment and supplies and 
                did not rely on porters and other outside support, and a rise in the number of people 
                climbing at high elevations without the use of supplemental oxygen.
                <br><br>
                Improvemnets of climbing gears such as Grade VII’s “Haul Pack” series (22, 36, and 55L) 
                which is  lightweight and durable multi-pitch/alpine climbing packs. 
                The packs are designed to be hauled without stowing the shoulder straps, 
                making for speedy approach/climb/haul transitions, and have just one haul loop. 
                Each pack features a rope strap, ice-tool attachments, and an exterior elastic bungee 
                cord to further increase carrying capacity.

            <p>
                Mountaineering is a pursuit that should never be undertaken 
                without a good understanding of the many different aspects involved, ranging from map 
                reading and navigation skills to rope work and understanding mountain weather. You should 
                definitely consider booking up with a reputable organisation offering expert advice.

                <br>
                <b>&#9632; Preparation and planning:</b> Take time to plan and prepare for your ascent. 
                This will be time well spent and the chances of your having a successful and enjoyable 
                ascent will be far higher if you have prepared well. Take time to plan your route and 
                prepare your kit regardless of whether you’re going for a short climb or a two month 
                expedition, some careful planning can make all the difference. As well as careful 
                planning, always check your kit before you leave … it is no good being out on the 
                mountain only to find you left your ice-ax at home. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <br>
                <b>&#9632; Footwear for mountaineering:</b>
                Make sure you invest in a good pair of rugged mountaineering 
                boots. For summer mountaineering you can get away with a stiff pair of walking boots, but 
                for winter mountaineering a crampon rated boot will be needed. Visit a reputable outdoor 
                retailer who will offer good advice on the best mountaineering boot to suit your needs.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <br>
                <b>&#9632; Food for mountaineering:</b> 
                 Make sure to carry plenty of food (and water) on any mountaineering trip. 
                Food needs to be high in energy and lightweight. Many high-energy bars and pre-packaged meals are 
                now available. Food can make or break longer expeditions so make sure the food you carry 
                is something tasty and enjoyable too! It is essential on any mountaineering trip to carry 
                emergency rations in case you are on the mountain for longer than anticipated. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                <br>
                <b>&#9632; Weather watching:</b> 
                 Before embarking on any mountaineering trip make sure you get a local 
                weather forecast. You can always postpone a summit attempt for another day, with more 
                favourable weather conditions. However, once you are on a mountaineering route you will 
                often be committed with little options for retreat so checking the weather in advance is 
                a must!
            </p>
            <p> 
                <br>
                <b>&#9632; Emergency shelter:</b> 
                 Too many completely avoidable accidents and injuries occur in 
                mountaineering because people simply underestimate the awesome forces of mountain 
                weather. Always carry an emergency shelter, they are small and lightweight but can 
                be life savers, protecting you from the elements should the weather suddenly turn. 
                There are many shelters available from two-person to large group shelters. Some of the 
                best available are Terra Novas Bothy Bags.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <br>
                <b>&#9632; Actions for an emergency:</b> 
                 Nobody wants to think that an accident will ever happen to 
                them but it would be foolhardy to think that this will always be the case. Take some time to 
                prepare for, and practice actions on different types of emergencies. High levels of 
                training mean you will react without having to think, which is beneficial since 
                decision-making abilities are severely impaired in stressful conditions.
